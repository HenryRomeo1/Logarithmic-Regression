## ðŸ“‰ Logarithmic Regression

**Problem Statement**:  
Model relationships between variables using a logarithmic regression approach.

**Data**:  
- Source: Logarithmic Regressions Dataset (`Bank Customer Churn Prediction`)

**Data Mining Operations**:  
- Conducted logarithmic transformations on independent variables.
- Applied regression modeling post-transformation.
- Split dataset into training/testing.
- Evaluated model performance with standard regression metrics.

**Model Outputs**:  
- Log-transformed regression plots.
- Performance evaluation metrics.

**Limitations**:  
- Logarithmic transformations may not be appropriate for all variables.

**Were you able to effectively solve the problem?**  
Yes, the logarithmic model better captured nonlinear relationships compared to simple linear models.
